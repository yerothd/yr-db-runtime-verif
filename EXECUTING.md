# REQUIRED client analysis verification / monitoring SOURCE CODE FILES

1. 'yr-db-runtime-verif-main.hpp' 
2. 'yr-db-runtime-verif-main.cpp' 


# HOW TO GET A SUCCESSFUL COMPILATION

You must provide C++ header and source files
named 'yr-db-runtime-verif-main.hpp' and
'yr-db-runtime-verif-main.cpp', WHERE YOU
DEFINE YOUR CLIENT ANALYSIS VERIFICATION

# HOW TO GET a generated analysis client from specification language 'YR_SD_RUNTIME_VERIF_LANG' 

1. THE PROJECT 'YR_SD_RUNTIME_VERIF_LANG_COMP' : 
	"https://github.com/yerothd/yr_sd_runtime_verif_lang"
  PROVIDES A WORKING STATE DIAGRAM MEALY 
  MACHINE into C++ SOURCE CODE FILES
	COMPILER that could generate files
  'yr-db-runtime-verif-main.hpp' and
  'yr-db-runtime-verif-main.cpp' FOR YOU.
